# Julia
As I've struggled a little bit in finding a comprehensible and accessible Julia notebooks for beginners, I've decided to create this repository to collect the knowledge and the Julia code that I will develop throughout my journey.
My plan for this repository is:
1) Create a set of Notebooks containing basic Julia commands.

   As of now, the **Basic Commands** folder contains: 
   - **Julia Types**
   - **Julia Advanced Types** (Composite/Mutable/Parametric Composite Types & Type Union)
   - **Julia Operators** (Arithmetic, Logical and Boolean Operators)
   - **Julia Data Structures** (Arrays, Vectors, Matrices, Tuples, Dictionaries and Sets)
   - **Julia Programming Structures** (Loops, Conditionals and Functions)
   - **Metaprogramming In Julia** (Expressions, Macros and Generated Functions)
   - **Extras** (Random Numbers, Parrallel, Try Catch-Errors and Plots)
2) Create a set of Notebooks containing more advanced algorithm coded in Julia. As of now I plan to write two algorithms for solving the TSP problem (greedy and simulated annealing).

If you notice any error in the notebooks or you would like to prorpose some changes to the notebooks, send me an email.
