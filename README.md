# Julia
As I've struggled a little bit in finding a comprehensible and accessible Julia notebooks, I've decided to create this repository to collect the Julia code that I will develop throughout my Journey. 
My plan for this repository is:
1) Create a set of Notebooks containing basic Julia commands
2) Create a set of Notebooks containing more advanced algorithm coded in Julia. As of now I plan write two algorithms for solving the TSP problem (greedy and simulated annealing)

If you notice any error in the notebooks or you would like to prorpose a change just drop an email.
