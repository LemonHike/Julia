# Julia
As I've struggled a little bit in finding a comprehensible and accessible Julia notebooks for beginners, I've decided to create this repository to collect then knowledge and the Julia code that I will develop throughout my self.study Journey. 
My plan for this repository is:
1) Create a set of Notebooks containing basic Julia commands.

   As of now, the repository contains: 
   - Julia Types
   - Julia Operators
2) Create a set of Notebooks containing more advanced algorithm coded in Julia. As of now I plan to write two algorithms for solving the TSP problem (greedy and simulated annealing).

If you notice any error in the notebooks or you would like to prorpose a change just drop an email.
