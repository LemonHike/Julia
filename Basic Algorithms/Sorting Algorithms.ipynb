    "**Note**: As expected, the Worst case running time of Merge Sort ($O(n \\ log(n))$) is much better than the worst case running time of Quick Sort ($O(n^2)$). However, by randomizing the pivoting element, we can easily avoid the worst case running time, obtaining a much better performance than Merge Sort. ***Thus, randomized quick sort is preferable to merge sort both in terms of efficiency and memory allocation.***\n"
